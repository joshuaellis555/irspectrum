# irspectrum
Hello all!

This is the repository for our CSC450 project. This application is a node.js/express server that will take IR Spectrum readings from the user and compare those graphs to the graphs already stored in the database.

You will need to download and install Node, Python, and PIP

To run our application, start by downloading the repository. Once it has been downloaded and set up, open the shell of your choice, go to the directory of the project, and input

```console
npm i
pip install -r requirements.txt
python UpdateDB.py
node main.js
```

Place your Sci-Finder PDF's in the IR_samples folder and run UpdateDB.py

and then you should be able to visit the website at http://localhost:3000

For all comments, concerns, questions, etc., you can contact us at amatthews4851@gmail.com

Thank you and enjoy.
